 3. Power BI: Created interactive dashboards to showcase findings and visualizations [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

## Data Preparations and Cleaning
- Data Quality Check: The data types of each column were changed to their respective data types
- Duplicates: the dataset contained over a thousand duplicates, it was detected using conditional formatting, and the duplicates were removed using the remove duplicates in the data tab

## Insights
1. Revenue by Region: Revenue is evenly distributed across the four regions (East, North, South, West), each contributing 25% to the total revenue.
2. Revenue by Subscription Type: The Basic subscription plan generates the highest revenue, followed by Premium and Standard. This could indicate that most customers prefer the Basic plan.
3. Canceled Subscriptions: 51% of the subscriptions are marked as canceled, indicating a fairly high churn rate.
4. Revenue by Customer: Some customers contribute more significantly to revenue, with a visible variation across the customer base.
5. Revenue by Month: There is some monthly fluctuation in revenue, with certain months showing higher revenue generation.
6. Average Revenue by Metrics: Average revenue by region and subscription type shows consistent levels across categories, with slightly higher averages for Basic and Premium subscriptions.

## Conclusions
1. High Cancellation Rate: The high percentage of canceled subscriptions suggests there may be issues with customer retention.
2. Popularity of Basic Subscription: The Basic plan is the most popular, which may indicate that customers prefer a more affordable option with essential features.
3. Stable Regional Distribution: All regions contribute equally, indicating a well-established customer base across different areas.
4. Revenue Peaks in Specific Months: The fluctuations in monthly revenue could be due to seasonal trends, promotional activities, or other external factors.

## Recommendations
1. Customer Retention Strategy: Investigate the causes of the high cancellation rate and consider implementing strategies like loyalty programs, special offers, or improved customer support to reduce cancellations.
2. Upselling Opportunities: Since the Basic plan is the most popular, consider creating upsell offers to encourage customers to switch to Premium or Standard plans by highlighting added benefits.
3. Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing: Identify high-revenue customers and tailor marketing or engagement efforts to retain them, as they play a significant role in overall revenue.
4. Subscription Improvement: Enhance the Basic plan with additional, low-cost features to increase its value proposition while maintaining affordability, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and retention.
